# genpeer.sh

This is a crude beta version of a simple script that generates peer configuration files for wireguard tunnel[s] in /etc/wireguard/peers/ given the self explanatory parameters.
Run it without parameters to get the correct syntax.
The IP addresses are substituted by letters for obvious reasons but it should be easy to replace them with the correct ones.
